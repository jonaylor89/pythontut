# Section 7: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
----------------------------------------------------

Most new programming languages (including python)
are what are called 'object oriented' languages.
This means they have something called 'classes' and 'objects'.
For people learning how to program, classes and objects are
one of the hardest things to understand. They are very simple
and useful once you master them but it's super hard to get
your head around what they are if you've never used them.

So just practice writing more classes, the more you do the more you comprehend them.
And if you still can not comprehend them, by the end of this tutorial you will be able to use them and that is what counts for now.

Right after you finish this do the challenges

We start with the syntax:

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, id, numID):
        self.id = id
	self.numID = numID
```

The first line ```class``` is the start for all the classes.

Followed by the name of the class and a ```:```

Then we have the ```___init__``` method.
All it does is initialize our variables (Not really but for the sake of simplicity we will assume it's true)

Then we have ```self``` followed by whatever variables we need.

To be continued...
